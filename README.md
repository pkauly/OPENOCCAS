# OPENOCCAS
Open Platform for Business occasion execution

Getting Started

A concept document is currently under construction. The progress can be viewed at [Link to Document](documents/OPENOCCAS_Concept.odt). 

The main objectives of the openoccas project are:
  * Getting control over the privison of service out of processes
  * Getting conrtol over the dataflows

This two controls are absolutely necessary to transform an enterprise to the new digital service world. 

An other important subject is the focus on customer orientation. As in many articles the reduction and disappearance of jobs is mentioned as the main impact of digitalization, the customer orientation of an enterprise will be the key success factor. Jobs will of course change a lot in the future, but a bit differently than most tech people think today.

A major mistake of today digitalization discussion is the fact that chat bots and other fancy AI tools will be able to satisfy customer needs and wishes. Perhaps in many years that may become the real world, but not the next twenty years. 

So opencass will provide a concept to go forward to the future, but taking human beings and there current behavior into account. And it provides features to integrate AI tools when they really become usable and providing added value.

The project will appreciate any support on the JAVA environment to get it integrated with jbpm and spring to make it fully operable in an open source environment. 

# Further development of openoccas
Installations instructions will be provided when executable code is available. Next step of the project is do describe the concept behind the planned platform.
